  <h1>Josi's Recipe Book</h1>
<p>
 These are some of my family's recipies! Because of this, a lot of the instructions are not 
  very specific, but are more along the lines of how I learned how to make, and how they
  have been passed down through my family. If you end up making any of them, I might be able 
  to give more specific instructions/ingredients!

  <h2 id="lemon">Lemon and Parmesan Pasta</h2>
  <p>
    This is a recipe of my own, adapted from the cookbook <em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.chefbentish.com/books-and-writing">Sicilia</a></em> by Ben Tish. 
    It makes for a great late night meal, and is pretty easy to throw together. It's essentially my quicker version for when I don't have the energy to cook. By the way, you can totally make it with leftover pasta, I do all the time.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Time:It's a race. Maybe 10-15, not counting the time it takes to cook the pasta.</li>
    <li>Serves: As much as you want.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Cook the pasta and set aside. Save some of the pasta water for later.</li>
    <li>In a medium sized pan, start heating up some olive oil. Then, add the breadcrumbs. 
      In an ideal world, you would lightly toast it. If you're in a rush, cook it until your patience runs out because you're too hungry.</li>
    <li>Add garlic. Then add in cooked pasta and lemon juice. Cook for like a minute or so.</li>
    <li>Remove the pan from heat. Add in a splash on the reserved pasta water. Start mixing in the cheese, a bit at a time, until you're happy with it.</li>
    <li>Add any additional seasonings you'd like. Enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2 id="pastina">Pastina</h2>
    This is a fabulous meal if you are feeling a bit under the weather, or just want something nice
    and warm and hearty! Also, this probably isn't the traditional way to make it, but it's the way 
    I usually make it because I don't know that way.
  <ul>
    <li>Time:30 minutes? I never checked.</li>
    <li>Serves: About one decently large bowl</li>

  <p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Chop the celery and onion (and the garlic if you're using fresh garlic. I never do). Dice the onion and cut the celery in the normal way to cut it.</li>
    <li>In a medium sized pot, melt a bit of butter, and throw in the garlic. Cook that for a tiny bit, and then add the celery and onion. Cook until it looks good (you don't need to fully cook it because it will cook in the broth). </li>
    <li>Add two cups of water to the pot, and bring to a boil.</li>
    <li>When the water boils, stir in the buillon. If you just used broth to start out with, skip this step.</li>
    <li>Add in the pastina. Bring down the heat a bit, and cover</li>
    <li>Cook the pastina until the liquid has been largely absorbed, about 6-8 minutes. Stir when you remember to.</li>
    <li>Remove the pot from heat. Stir in parmesan, and any additional butter or olive oil you wanted to add. Then, season to taste.</li>
    <li>Serve in a bowl, and add a little parmesan on top! Enjoy!</li>
